## Reporting a Vulnerability

## Security Updates

Security updates will be issued regularly for supported versions. It is recommended to promptly apply these updates to ensure the security of your application.

## Responsible Disclosure

We believe in responsible disclosure. When security vulnerabilities are reported, we will work closely with the reporter to understand and address the issue promptly. We appreciate the reporter's cooperation in not disclosing the issue publicly until a fix can be provided.

## Incident Response Process

Our team follows a structured incident response process for addressing security incidents. This includes:

1. **Report:** The security issue is reported to our security contact.
2. **Assessment:** The security team assesses the reported issue and determines its impact.
3. **Resolution:** A fix or workaround is developed and tested.
4. **Notification:** Once a fix is ready, affected users are notified and provided with details of the vulnerability along with instructions to update.
5. **Disclosure:** After users have had reasonable time to update, the security issue is disclosed publicly.

## Bug Bounty Program

We currently do not operate a bug bounty program for our project. However, we appreciate and encourage responsible disclosure, and any security researcher reporting a valid security issue will be acknowledged.

Thank you for your contributions to the security of our project!
